## This tool can be used to perform multiple ligand docking on the cloud,without using the user computer resources.
please open the sazdock.ipynb in your google colab workspace |

### Steps
1.Download the folder

2.Add ligands in .pdbqt format to the ligands folder

3.Add receptor file .pdbqt format to the sazdock  main folder

4.Change the conf.txt to the required parameters


The sazdock folder should contain Receptor.pdbqt,ligands(folder),vina,conf.txt,dock.ini

5.Upload the sazdock folder to your main google drive

6.Mount the drive by running the cell in colab,and run the next cell to perform the help function of the cell

7.The last cell contains the code which has the protein name change it accordingly, and run the code to perform docking

8.The results can be found in the sazdock folder in your drive
